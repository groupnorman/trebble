# About
Trebble is a Pebble smart watch app for finding the next departing busses in Tampere, Finland. It uses GPS location to find your nearest stops and shows the next lines departing from those stops. This source supports all currently available Pebble models, including the latest Pebble 2 which was the last Pebble smart watch released before Fitbit acquired Pebble.

# Usage
This app is licenced under a MIT license. You can use it to do pretty much anything you want. The easiest way to modify and build the code is to download the whole source and open it in Pebble's [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net/) platform. Take note that the icons are downloaded from Freepik (see the README file in the resources/images folder).
